/**
 * @title AntseedWashTradingRegistry
 * @notice Records proof-carrying wash-trading findings. A finding is a
 *         zero-knowledge proof that a funding loop exists on this chain:
 *         seller → (forwarding hops) → funder → buyer, followed by
 *         buyer → seller settlement volume, all read from authenticated
 *         Base receipts inside the zkVM guest.
 *
 *         Submission is permissionless: validity comes entirely from the
 *         RISC Zero seal, which only exists for an honest execution of the
 *         guest whose hash is `imageId`. The contract is fully immutable —
 *         no owner, no setters. One registry IS one rule version: a new
 *         predicate ships as a new registry deployment, and consumers switch
 *         via AntseedUsageAccounting.setPointsPolicy. Recorded findings are
 *         permanent; nobody, including the deployer, can accept, remove, or
 *         alter one outside the proof path.
 *
 *         Consumers: AntseedWashTradingPointsPolicy reads `isFlagged` from
 *         AntseedUsageAccounting's points hook so flagged buyer/seller edges
 *         accrue zero reward points.
 *
 * @dev    Evidence block hashes are checked against `blockhashSource`
 *         (AntseedBlockhashKeeper). Fresh evidence must therefore be
 *         checkpointed or submitted within the native 256-block window.
 *         Historical evidence older than the keeper's records needs a guest
 *         version that walks parent hashes to a recent anchor (predicate v2).
