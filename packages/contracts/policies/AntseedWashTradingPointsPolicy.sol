 * @title AntseedWashTradingPointsPolicy
 * @notice Points policy for AntseedUsageAccounting: buyer/seller edges with a
 *         proven funding loop in the wash-trading registry accrue zero reward
 *         points. Every other edge passes through unchanged.
 *
 * @dev    Wired via AntseedUsageAccounting.setPointsPolicy. The accounting
 *         hook wraps the call in try/catch, but this policy is deliberately a
 *         single mapping read with no revert path and no value amplification,
 *         per the stack's never-block-settlement invariant. Stateless: a new
 *         registry means deploying a new policy.
